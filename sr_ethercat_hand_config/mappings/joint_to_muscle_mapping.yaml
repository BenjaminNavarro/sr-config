##
# This file contains the mapping between the muscles and the joints:
#
# Every joint is controlled by two muscles.
#
# Some joints are virtual joints that group other joints. e.g. FFJ0 is the combination of FFJ1 and FFJ2, that are actuated by the same pair of muscles
# The first muscle of every pair is the flexor muscle, the second is the extensor muscle
#
#
# Every muscle is defined by a pair [muscle_driver_ID, muscle_ID]
# the muscle_ID is relative to a certain muscle driver, e.g. [0, 6] is the 6th muscle of the muscle driver 0.
